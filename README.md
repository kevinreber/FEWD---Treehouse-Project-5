# FEWD - Treehouse Project 5
## Project Introduction
In this project, you will create an interactive photo gallery using JavaScript and jQuery. Thumbnails and photos will be provided with descriptions. At the top of the page, you'll have a search area where photos will hide and show depending on user input. When the user clicks on a thumbnail, the photo will display in a lightbox. There should be a back and previous arrows to cycle through photos.
    
## Project Instructions

-   #### Build the web page layout using HTML and CSS, using the layout in the gallery_mockup.png file.
    
    -   Create a gallery using the provided thumbnail images.
    -   Create a search box field.
    -   The design does not need to be exact, but the general spacing and arrangement of the elements should match the design of the mockups.
    
-   #### Research, find and implement a jQuery plugin for a lightbox. This must include the following functionality and features:
    
    -   The ability to click on thumbnail images in the gallery and view them in a lightbox.
    -   A background overlay that appears and covers the entire window when displaying a larger image.
    -   The ability to add text captions to each image in the lightbox.
    -   Back and forward arrows to switch between photos when the lightbox is visible.
    -   Make sure there is a way to close the lightbox and return to the gallery view.
    
-   #### Research, find and implement a jQuery plugin for the search box. This must include the following functionality and features:
    
    -   The search box at the top of the page should filters photos based on the captions.
    -   The photos should filter in real-time as you type, and only display photos that match the search.
    
-   #### Make sure to check your code is valid by running it through an HTML and CSS validator.
    
    -   Links to the validators can be found in the Project Resources. This will help you spot any errors that might be in your code.
    -   **There are a few exceptions that you don’t need to fix:**
        -   Don’t worry about any warnings, we just need you to check any errors that might be there.
        -   If CSS validator flags use of calc, vendor prefixes or pseudo-elements/pseudo-classes these errors should be ignored.
        -   If HTML validator flags use of pipe (‘|’) in Google font links/URLs this error can also be ignored.
    
-   #### You should also check for issues with your JavaScript code using JSHint, linked in the Project Resources.
    
    JSHint may show you some warnings, so make sure to check through those for any potential problems. You do not need to fix every warning listed but reviewing them can be useful.
        

## Extra Credit

To get an "exceeds" rating, complete all of the steps below:


-   #### Include a mobile-first design for both the gallery page and the lightbox:
    
    -   Use media queries to make sure that the photos and layout adjust for a mobile-friendly experience.
    
-   #### Write your own JavaScript or jQuery code instead of using a jQuery plugin for the search/content filtering requirement.
